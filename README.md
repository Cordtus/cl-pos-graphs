# Concentrated Liquidity Positions, Graphed

---

Fully interactive [in terminal]. Generates a 3-d plot chart showing the general spread, depth and concentration of liquidity positions by calling `liquidity_per_tick_range`.


Option to export chart image [`png` format] and/or `CSV` file to `./data/` in the same directory the script is run from.
Optional block height [leave blank for default - latest height]


If it doesn't seem to work, try changing the REST/LCD URL at the top of the script.
